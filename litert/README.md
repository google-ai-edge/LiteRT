# LiteRT Overview

LiteRT (short for Lite Runtime), formerly known as TensorFlow Lite, is Google's
high-performance runtime for on-device AI. You can find ready-to-run LiteRT
models for a wide range of ML/AI tasks, or convert and run TensorFlow, PyTorch,
and JAX models to the TFLite format using the AI Edge conversion and
optimization tools.
