## Description

LiteRT continues the legacy of TensorFlow Lite as the trusted, high-performance
runtime for on-device AI.

LiteRT V2 (aka Next as announced at Google IO '25), introduced a new set of
APIs, featuring advanced GPU/NPU acceleration, delivering superior performance,
and making on-device ML inference easier than ever.

### üöÄ Status: Alpha

- LiteRT V2 is an alpha release and under active development.
- Join **LiteRT NPU Early access program**:
  [g.co/ai/LiteRT-NPU-EAP](https://g.co/ai/LiteRT-NPU-EAP)

### üåü What's New

- **üÜï New LiteRT v2 API**: Streamline development with automated accelerator
  selection, true async execution, and efficient I/O buffer handling.

  - Automated accelerator selection vs explicit delegate creation
  - Async execution for faster overall execution time
  - Easy NPU runtime and model distribution
  - Efficient I/O buffer handling

- **ü§ñ Unified NPU Acceleration**: Offer seamless access to NPUs from major
  chipset providers with a consistent developer experience. LiteRT NPU
  acceleration is available through an Early Access Program.

- **‚ö° Best-in-class GPU Performance**: Use state-of-the-art GPU acceleration for
  on-device ML. The new buffer interoperability enables zero-copy and minimizes
  latency across various GPU buffer types.

- **üß† Superior Generative AI inference**: Enable the simplest integration with
  the best performance for GenAI models.

## üèÅ Installation

For a comprehensive guide to setting up your application with LiteRT Next, see
the [Get Started guide](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert).

You can build LiteRT from source:

1. Start a docker daemon.
1. Run `build_with_docker.sh` under `docker_build/`

The script automatically creates a Linux Docker image, which allows you to build
artifacts for Linux and Android (through cross compilation). See build
instructions in [CMake build instructions](./CMAKE_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
and [Bazel build instructions](./BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for more information on
how to build runtime libraries with the docker container.

For more information about using docker interactive shell or building different
targets, please refer to `docker_build/README.md`.

## üó∫ Choose Your Adventure

Every developer's path is different. Here are a few common journeys to help you
get started based on your goals:

### 1. üîÑ I have a PyTorch model...

- **Goal**: Convert a model from PyTorch to run on LiteRT.
- **Path1 (classic models)**: Use the
  [AI Edge Torch Converter](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-torch) to
  transform your PyTorch model into the `.tflite` format, and use AI Edge
  Quantizer to optimize the model for optimal performance under resource
  constraints. From there, you can deploy it using the standard LiteRT runtime.
- **Path2 (LLMs)**: Use
  [Torch Generative API](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/ai-edge-torch) to
  reauthor and convert your PyTorch LLMs into Apache format, and deploy it using
  [LiteRT LM](https://github.com/google/litert).

### 2. üå± I'm new to on-device ML...

- **Goal**: Run a pre-trained model (like image segmentation) in a mobile app
  for the first time.
- **Path1 (Beginner dev)**: Follow step-by-step instructions via Android Studio
  to create a
  [Real-time segmentation App](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/litert-image-segmentation-android#0)
  for CPU/GPU/NPU inference. Source code
  [link](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/litert-samples/tree/main/v2/image_segmentation).
- **Path2 (Experienced dev)**: Start with the
  [Get Started guide](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/next/get_started), find
  a pre-trained .tflite model on [Kaggle Models](https://www.kaggle.com/models),
  and use the standard LiteRT runtime to integrate it into your Android or iOS
  app.

### 3. ‚ö° I need to maximize performance...

- **Goal**: Accelerate an existing model to run faster and more efficiently
  on-device.
- **Path**:
  - Explore the [LiteRT API](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/next/overview) to
    easily leverage hardware acceleration. Learn how to enable the GPU
    acceleration or the NPU acceleration (NPU EAP:
    [g.co/ai/LiteRT-NPU-EAP](https://g.co/ai/LiteRT-NPU-EAP)).
  - **For working with Generative AI**: Dive into
    [LiteRT LM](https://github.com/google/litert), our specialized solution for
    running GenAI models.

### 4. üß† I'm working with Generative AI...

- **Goal**: Deploy a large language model (LLM) or diffusion model on a mobile
  device.
- **Path**: Dive into [LiteRT LM](https://github.com/google/litert), our
  specialized solution for running GenAI models. You'll focus on model
  quantization and optimizations specific to large model architectures.

## üó∫ Roadmap

Our commitment is to make LiteRT the best runtime for any on-device ML
deployment. Our product strategies are:

- **Expanding Hardware Acceleration**: Broadening our support for NPUs and
  improving performance across all major hardware accelerators.
- **Generative AI Optimizations**: Introducing new optimizations and features
  specifically for the next wave of on-device generative AI models.
- **Improving Developer Tools**: Building better tools for debugging, profiling,
  and optimizing models.
- **Platform Support**: Enhancing support for core platforms and exploring new
  ones.

## üó∫ What's Next:

**Beta by Oct 2025:**

- Achieve feature parity with TensorFlow Lite
- Expand GPU backend support
- Proactively increase ML and GenAI model coverage
- Broader LiteRT Runtime/Converter upgrades from TensorFlow Lite

**General Availability by Google IO, May 2026**
