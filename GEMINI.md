# Interaction Guidelines

## Planning vs. Execution
*   **Update Plans Only When Asked:** If the user requests updates to a plan, documentation, or task list (e.g., "Update Phase 2 into smaller tasks", "Update the plan doc"), **ONLY** perform the documentation update.
*   **Do Not Auto-Execute:** Do not proceed to execute the newly defined tasks immediately. Wait for an explicit instruction from the user to start the implementation (e.g., "Go ahead", "Execute step 1").
*   **Confirm Scope:** If there is ambiguity between refining a plan and executing it, err on the side of planning and ask for confirmation before modifying code.
